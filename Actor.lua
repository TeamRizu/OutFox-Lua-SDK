--- Set the Actor's effect timing.
--- 
--- `hold_at_zero` is before `hold_at_full` in the argument list for compatibility.
--- A future version will probably swap them because it makes more sense to have `hold_at_full` come before `hold_at_zero`.
--- 
--- All effect timings must be greater than or equal to zero, at least one of them must be greater than zero.
--- 
--- The effect timing controls how long it takes an effect to cycle and how long it spends in each phase.
--- 
--- Depending on the effect clock, the actor's time into effect is updated every frame.
--- That time is then translated into a `percent_through_effect` using the parameters to this function.
---
--- - `ramp_to_half` is the amount of time for `percent_through_effect` to reach 0.5.<br />
--- - `hold_at_half` is the amount of time `percent_through_effect` will stay at 0.5.<br />
--- - `ramp_to_full` is the amount of time `percent_through_effect` will take to go from 0.5 to 1.0.<br />
--- - `hold_at_full` is the amount of time `percent_through_effect` will stay at 1.0.<br />
--- - After reaching the end of hold_at_full, `percent_through_effect` stays at 0 until `hold_at_zero` is over.<br />
---
--- The different effects use `percent_through_effect` in different ways.  Some use it to calculate `percent_between_colors` with this sine wave:
--- ```lua
--- sin((percent_through_effect + 0.25f) * 2 * PI ) / 2 + 0.5f
--- ```
---
--- Some effects check the internal bool `blink_on`.  `blink_on` is true if `percent_through_effect` is greater than 0.5 and false if `percent_through_effect` is less than or equal to 0.5.
--- 
--- Check the effect functions for individual explanations.
